# Fossils Depth Distribution Analysis

This repository contains code for generating depth distribution graphs of fossil compositions and chemical compounds, based on geological data.

## Files
- `generate_plots.py`: Python script to generate depth distribution plots.
- `README.md`: Project description and instructions.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python and the required packages installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   ```

2. Run the script to generate the plots:
   ```bash
   python generate_plots.py
   ```

3. The generated plots will be saved in the current directory as `.png` files.

## Step-by-Step Screenshots
1. **Run Script**: Run `generate_plots.py` in your terminal or command prompt.
2. **Check Outputs**: After execution, check the current directory for saved plot images named as `mod4_table1_*` and `mod4_table2_*` for each variable.
